MultiZone® Security for Microsemi Polarfire SoC

**MultiZone® Security** is the quick and safe way to add security and separation to RISC-V processors. MultiZone software can retrofit existing designs. If you don’t have TrustZone-like hardware, or if you require finer granularity than one secure world, you can take advantage of high security separation without the need for hardware and software redesign, eliminating the complexity associated with managing a hybrid hardware/software security scheme. RISC-V standard ISA doesn't define TrustZone-like primitives to provide hardware separation. To shield critical functionality from untrusted third-party components, MultiZone provides hardware-enforced, software-defined separation of multiple equally secure worlds. Unlike antiquated hypervisor-like solutions, MultiZone is self-contained, presents an extremely small attack surface, and it is policy driven, meaning that no coding is required – and in fact even allowed.

MultiZone works with any 32-bit or 64-bit RISC-V standard processors  with Physical Memory Protection unit and U mode.

This version of the GNU-based SDK supports the following development hardware:

### MultiZone SDK Installation ###

The MultiZone SDK works with any versions of Linux, Windows, and Mac capable of running Java 1.8 or greater. The directions in this readme have been verified with fresh installations of Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 19.10, Ubuntu 18.04.5, and Debian 10.5. Other Linux distros are similar. Windows developers may want to install a Linux emulation environment like Cygwin or run the SDK in a Linux VM guest (2GB Disk, 2GB Ram)

**Linux prerequisites**

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make default-jre gtkterm libhidapi-dev libftdi1-2
```
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS additional dependency

```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main universe"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libncurses-dev
```
Note: GtkTerm is optional and required only to connect to the reference application via UART. It is not required to build, debug, and load the MultiZone software. Any other serial terminal application of choice would do.

**GNU RISC-V Toolchain**

Hex Five reference build: RISC-V GNU Toolchain Linux 64-bit June 13, 2020
```
cd ~
wget https://hex-five.com/wp-content/uploads/riscv-gnu-toolchain-20200613.tar.xz
tar -xvf riscv-gnu-toolchain-20200613.tar.xz
```

**OpenOCD on-chip debugger**

Hex Five reference build: RISC-V openocd Linux 64-bit June 13, 2020
```
cd ~
wget https://hex-five.com/wp-content/uploads/riscv-openocd-20200613.tar.xz
tar -xvf riscv-openocd-20200613.tar.xz
```

**Linux USB udev rules**

```
sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/99-openocd.rules

# Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT2232C Dual USB-UART/FIFO IC
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403",ATTRS{idProduct}=="6010", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor} =="0403",ATTR{idProduct} =="6010", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"

# Olimex Ltd. ARM-USB-TINY-H JTAG interface

```
Reboot for these changes to take effect.

**MultiZone Security SDK**

```
cd ~
wget https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-sdk/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv multizone-sdk-master multizone-sdk
```

### Build & load the MultiZone reference application ###

Connect the target board to the development workstation as indicated in the user manual.

'ls multizone-sdk/bsp' shows the list of supported targets: X300, E31, S51, PFSOC.

Assign one of these values to the BOARD variable - default is X300.

```
cd ~/multizone-sdk
export RISCV=~/riscv-gnu-toolchain-20200613
export OPENOCD=~/riscv-openocd-20200613
export BOARD=X300
make 
make load
```
Note: With some older versions of the ftdi libraries, the first "make load" after powering the board may take a bit longer than it should. If you don't want to wait, the simple workaround is to reset the FPGA board to abort the openOCD session. If you do this, make sure to kill the openocd process on your computer. Subsequent loads will work as expected and take approximately 10 seconds.

Important: make sure that switch SW3 is positioned close to the edge of the board.

Important: open jumper JP2 (CK RST) to prevent a system reset upon UART connection.



### Run the MultiZone reference application ###

Connect the UART port (ARTY micro USB J10) as indicated in the user manual.

On your computer, start a serial terminal console (GtkTerm) and connect to /dev/ttyUSB1 at 115200-8-N-1

Hit the enter key a few times until the cursor 'Z1 >' appears on the screen

Enter 'restart' to display the splash screen

Hit enter again to show the list of available commands

```
